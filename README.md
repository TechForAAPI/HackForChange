# Welcome to #Hack For Change - let's build creative solutions to help the AAPI community!

### Why this Hackathon

A horrific and heartbreaking surge in violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) is happening across the US. As our commitment to uplifting and protecting the AAPI community, we want to unite the Tech communities to stand with the AAPI community.

On April 2, we hosted[ #TechforAAPI Virtual Rally](http://bit.ly/Tech4AAPI).

We believe a hackathon can not only inspire the next billion-dollar unicorns but also help unite mission-driven innovators drive positive social changes with the help of technology. We look for product people and developers across the globe to participate and create works, including but not limited to product prototypes, coding, user experience design, and business/social impact models.
