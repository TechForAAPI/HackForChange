# Welcome to #Hack For Change - let's build creative solutions to help the AAPI community!

## Why this Hackathon

A horrific and heartbreaking surge in violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) is happening across the US. As our commitment to uplifting and protecting the AAPI community, we want to unite the Tech communities to stand with the AAPI community.

On April 2, we hosted[ #TechforAAPI Virtual Rally](http://bit.ly/Tech4AAPI).

“It’s not enough to agree, you have to act too. No matter who you are, if you care, get involved.” - said Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram.

We believe a hackathon can not only inspire the next billion-dollar unicorns but also help unite mission-driven innovators drive positive social changes with the help of technology. We look for product people and developers across the globe to participate and create works, including but not limited to product prototypes, coding, user experience design, and business/social impact models.

## FAQs

**Q: What is the purpose of this Hackathon?** 

In response to rising inequality and incidence of hate crimes, it is critical for the tech community to come together in support of the AAPI community and to tackle challenges with a creative approach. We believe that open collaboration across the globe can increase the likelihood of success for building innovative solutions. Thus, we are excited to rally everyone, particularly those with experiences in engineering, product or technology more broadly to build creative technical solutions.

**Q: Who are the organizers?**

We are the same group of passionate Tech people who hosted #TechforAAPI Virtual Rally. We come from Tech companies like Netflix, Pinterest, and Salesforce and communities including GongYouJi(工友记), Product Pub, Shinect, SJTU-SV, THAA-NC, The Society of Heart’s Delight (瑜园社), UXRenUS, and X-lab.

**Q: Who is eligible to participate?**

We are seeking individuals who can leverage exponential technologies of their choice to deliver locally focused or globally relevant solutions for a range of challenge areas sourced from the AAPI community. We aim to bring in individuals who can leverage skills including but not limited to product prototyping, coding, user experience design and business/social impact models among others to build effective solutions in support of the AAPI community.

**Q: Can I participate if I can't write code?**

Yes. We welcome three types of audiences and participants: 1) Individuals that can contribute in a team, 2) Judges and mentors, such as entrepreneurs, social innovators, venture capitalists, etc, 3) Anyone who is interested in this activity and would like to observe and learn. Moreover, you can also join our series of activities hosted during the hackathon. It will be a good opportunity for you to observe and learn.

**Q: Can I participate if I don’t have an idea in mind?**

Yes. You can join the other team and contribute in coding, designing, marketing, and etc. You can also buy the audience ticket and join the official discussion group. Through observing and studying, you may spark ideas with others

**Q: Can I sign up without a team?**

Yes. You will have the opportunity to pitch your ideas during the Lightning Pitch sessions, and find potential team members through such events and our Slack channels.

**Q: What will I get if I contribute?**

As a participant in the hackathon (open to anyone interested), you would have the opportunity to work closely with teammates who share your passion as well as to learn insights from leaders in tech who will be assigned to each participating team as mentors. All teams and participants will have the opportunity to publicly demonstrate their work, including potential coverage by media partners of the Tech for AAPI Alliance. This hackathon will take place over 3 weeks, by the end of which judges and social media will vote for the best teams to receive grants to make their respective projects a reality. All projects will be open sourced and hosted on GitHub during the period of the hackathon, maximizing the team’s chance to be noticed by investors more broadly and hopefully long-term sustainable.

**Q: What are the expected deliverables & workloads?** 

A 2~5 min demo video is recommended for the final evaluation. You would also be given an opportunity to demonstrate your solution in a free-form format, in a safe and cozy environment.  You have approximately two weeks’ hands-on time, that’s primarily because some participants have a full-time job and have very limited bandwidth on weekdays. Feel free to spend time based on your own availability and bandwidth!
